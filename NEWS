2.6
---

This release removes the recently added support for setting the GPU for
Vulkan apps as this broke sandboxed Vulkan apps. The support should come
back soon when functionality gets added to VulkanLoader.

This release also fixes non-x86 platforms not having a default GPU.

2.5
---

This release adds support for setting the GPU to use for Vulkan apps, on
systems with heterogenous GPUs.

This release also fixes the "--gpu" option not working as documented, and
installs the D-Bus configuration file in the correct location.

2.4
---

This release fixes the cleaned-up name of some video cards not being picked
up, as well as adding a test suite.

2.3
---

This release fixes the path to the interpreter for the switcherooctl
tool added in 2.2.

2.2
---

This release adds a command-line utility to launch specific commands on
a specific GPU, or the first discrete one. See the reference documentation
or the switcherooctl(1) man page for details. The build system was also
ported to meson.

2.1
---

This release fixes the wrong data type being advertised in the introspection
XML for the GPUs property, which lead to incorrect auto-generated code,
and also fixes a potential assertion on startup.

2.0
---

This release adds a number of new properties to list GPUs, figure out
how to launch OpenGL client on specific GPUs, and figure out which
one is the default, in a way that supports the stock GPU drivers as well
as the NVidia proprietary drivers.

The service file itself also makes use of systemd's hardening features.

Note that the API was extended in a backwards compatible way.
